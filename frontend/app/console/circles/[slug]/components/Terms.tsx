        The ROSCA group, known as [Group Name], is established to facilitate
        collective savings and provide each member a lump sum payment during
        their designated turn. Membership is limited to [number] individuals who
        commit to the entire cycle. Each member contributes [amount] on a
        [weekly/bi-weekly/monthly] basis, with payments due by [specific date].
        The payout order will be determined by [method, e.g., lottery, mutual
        agreement], and any changes require unanimous consent. Meetings are held
        [frequency] at [location/online] to ensure transparency, during which
        the treasurer will report on collections and distributions. Late
        contributions incur a penalty of [amount], and persistent defaults may
        result in disqualification or other group-decided actions. All members
        are expected to maintain confidentiality regarding the groupâ€™s
        activities. Amendments to these terms can only be made with unanimous
        agreement, and the group will dissolve upon completion of the cycle
        unless a new cycle is agreed upon. By participating, all members agree
        to adhere to these terms, ensuring trust and accountability within the
        group.
